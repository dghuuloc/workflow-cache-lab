== Cache Facade Specification

=== Understanding Two-Tier Caching
In many applications, a two-tier caching system can improve performance by providing multiple layers of caching:

- **Primary Cache:** Often implemented using in-memory caches like Ehcache or Caffeine. It is typically fast but may not be as scalable.
- **Secondary Cache:** Redis can serve as this layer, providing a scalable and persistent cache that can handle larger datasets and complex querying.

Implementing a secondary cache with Redis allows you to offload some of the caching responsibilities from your primary cache, providing additional scalability and redundancy.

=== Enable Caching:
Add the `@EnableCaching` annotation to your main application class or a dedicated configuration class

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cache.annotation.EnableCaching;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableCaching // Enables Spring's caching mechanism
public class YourApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(YourApplication.class, args);
    }
}

=== Create a Service/Facade with Caching:
Define a service class (which can act as your CacheFacade) and annotate methods with caching annotations like `@Cacheable`, `@CachePut`, or `@CacheEvict`.

1. `@Cacheable`; Skips method execution if the result is already in the cache
2. `@CachePut`: Forces the method to execute and updates the cache with the result.
3. `@CacheEvict`: Removes data from the cache when a specific action occurs (e.g., deleting a user).
